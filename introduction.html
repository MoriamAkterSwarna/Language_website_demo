            <h2 >What is Python?</h2>
                <pre>
                     Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. 
                     It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.  </pre>
            <h2>It is used for:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>web development (server-side)</li>
                    <li>software development</li>
                    <li>mathematics</li>
                    <li>system scripting</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Python?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
                <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
                <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
                <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
            </ul>
