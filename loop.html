        <h1>Python Loop</h1>
        <h2>Python For Loops</h2>
        <pre>
            Python For loop is used for sequential traversal i.e. it is used for iterating over an iterable like string, tuple, list, etc. It falls under the category of definite iteration. 
            Definite iterations mean the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. 
            Note: In Python, for loops only implements the collection-based iteration.

            Syntax:

                for var in iterable:
                    # statements
        </pre>
        <h2>Python While Loop</h2>
        <pre>
            Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is 
            executed. While loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration. Indefinite iteration means that the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. 

            Syntax: 
            
            while expression:
                statement(s)

                Statements represent all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses 
                indentation as its method of grouping statements. When a while loop is executed, expr is first evaluated in a Boolean context and if it is true, the loop body is executed. Then the expr is 
                checked again, if it is still true then the body is executed again and this continues until the expression becomes false.

                Example 1: Python While Loop

                    # Python program to illustrate
                    # while loop
                        count = 0
                        while (count < 3):
                            count = count + 1
                            print("Hello World")
        </pre>
    </div>
